# Models
## 1) k-NN Classifier
### How to build
#### 1. Clone Repository and move to the cloned directory
~~~
git clone https://github.com/2023-ML-Ewha/practice.git
~~~

~~~
cd practice
~~~

<br> 

#### 2. Switch to branch 'knn'
~~~
git checkout knn
~~~

<br> 

#### 3. Open the directory and download the 'knn.py' file
~~~
open .
~~~
And download manually

<br> 

#### 4. Run the code(knn.py) using Google Colaboratory
Upload the file 'knn.py' and **dataset files** on the Google Colaboratory, and run the code. <br> The recommended experimental setting is:
Python 3 Google Compute Engine Backend
System RAM:1.3 / 12.7 GB 
Disk: 26.9 / 107.7 GB

<br> 

#### 4-1. (Optional and NOT recommended) just in case you have all the modules and if you want to run the code in the terminal:

Depending on the version of Python that you use, execute source code with the command below
~~~
python knn.py
~~~

or

~~~
python3 knn.py
~~~
<br> 
<br> 

cf) 'custom_knn.py' is an implementation of k-nn model which applied a custom distance function that was recommended in the paper(Wang et al. Effective Attacks and Provable Defenses for Website Fingerprinting (Usenix Security 14))
<br> 
<br> 

## 2) Random-Forest
### How to build
#### 1. Clone Repository and move to the cloned directory
~~~
git clone https://github.com/2023-ML-Ewha/practice.git
~~~

~~~
cd practice
~~~

<br> 

#### 2. Switch to branch 'random-forest'
~~~
git checkout random-forest
~~~

<br> 

#### 3. Open the directory and download the 'random_forest_final.ipynb' file 
~~~
start .
~~~
(The command is for a Windows environment.)
And download the file manually

<br> 

#### 4. Run the code(random_forest_final.ipynb) using Google Colaboratory
Upload the file 'random_forest_final.ipynb' and **dataset files** on the Google Colaboratory, and run the code. <br> The recommended experimental setting is:
Python 3 Google Compute Engine Backend
System RAM:1.1 / 12.7 GB 
Disk: 26.9 / 107.7 GB
